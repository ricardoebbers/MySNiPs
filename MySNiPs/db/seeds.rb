# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# x = Gene.create({:title=>"I3002455", :revid=>1195440, :orientation=>false, :stabilized=>false, :iid=>"3002455", :rsid=>"1800386", :position=>6127833, :chromosome=>"12"})
